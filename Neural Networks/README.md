2. **Model Implementation:** The models are implemented in Python using NumPy. The project includes:
   - Fully-connected neural networks
   - Convolutional neural networks
3. **Training and Optimization:** The training involves forward propagation, loss computation, and backpropagation for gradient updates. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with various optimization techniques is used.
4. **Evaluation:** The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and loss, with results visualized for analysis.

### Workflow
1. **Loading Data:** Using `datasets.py` to load and preprocess image data.
2. **Defining Network Architectures:** Implementing layers and activation functions in `layers.py` and `activations.py`.
3. **Training Models:** Training the models with `train_ffnn.py`, including forward and backward passes.
4. **Evaluating Performance:** Using metrics to evaluate the model's performance and visualizing the results.

## Mathematical Concepts

### Forward Propagation
- **Fully-connected Layer:** $\( h^{[l]} = \sigma(W^{[l]} h^{[l-1]} + b^{[l]}) \)$
- **Convolutional Layer:** $\( Z[d1, d2, n] = (X * W)[d1, d2, n] + b[n] \)$

### Activation Functions
- **ReLU:** $\( \sigma(z) = \max(0, z) \)$
- **Softmax:** $\( \sigma_i = \frac{e^{s_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{k} e^{s_j}} \)$

### Loss Functions
- **Cross-Entropy Loss:** $\( L = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} y_i \cdot \log(\hat{y}_i) \)$

### Backpropagation
- **Gradient Calculation:** Using the chain rule to compute gradients for each layer, enabling parameter updates.

## Machine Learning Concepts

### Neural Network Layers
- **Fully-Connected Layers:** Each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous and next layers.
- **Convolutional Layers:** Apply convolutional filters to input data to capture spatial hierarchies.

### Training Algorithms
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** Iteratively updates model parameters to minimize the loss function.
- **Backpropagation:** Computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter by the chain rule, iteratively updating the parameters.

## Python Concepts

### Libraries Used
- **NumPy:** For efficient numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **SciPy:** For additional numerical methods and optimizations.

### Coding Techniques
- **Modular Design:** Code is organized into modules such as `layers.py`, `activations.py`, `losses.py`, and `train_ffnn.py`.
- **Vectorized Operations:** Implementations use vectorized operations to ensure efficiency.
