2. **Model Implementation**: Developing and training models using AdaBoost, k-NN, and SVD.
3. **Evaluation and Optimization**: Assessing model performance and optimizing parameters.
4. **Visualization and Analysis**: Creating visualizations to interpret results and drawing conclusions.

## Mathematical Concepts
### AdaBoost
AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier. The key mathematical components include:
- **Weighted Error Rate**: $\( err_t = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^{(t)} \cdot \mathbf{1}(y_i \neq G_t(x_i))}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^{(t)}} \)$
- **Classifier Weight**: $\( \alpha_t = \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{1 - err_t}{err_t} \right) \)$
- **Weight Update**: $\( w_i^{(t+1)} = w_i^{(t)} \exp(-\alpha_t y_i G_t(x_i)) \)$

### k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
k-NN predicts the label of a data point based on the labels of its k nearest neighbors. The main mathematical concept is:
- **Distance Calculation**: Typically, Euclidean distance $\( d(x_i, x_j) = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^d (x_{ik} - x_{jk})^2} \)$ is used.

### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
SVD decomposes a matrix $\( R \)$ into three matrices $\( U \), \( D \), and \( V^T \)$:
- **Matrix Decomposition**: $\( R = UDV^T \)$
- **Feature Vectors**: User and item vectors are derived from the matrices $\( U \)$ and $\( V \)$.

## Machine Learning Concepts
### AdaBoost
AdaBoost is an ensemble learning method that improves the accuracy of weak classifiers by adjusting their weights based on their performance. It iteratively trains classifiers, each focusing on the mistakes of the previous ones.

### k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
k-NN is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. It predicts the output based on the majority label (for classification) or average value (for regression) of the k closest data points.

### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
SVD is a matrix factorization technique used to reduce the dimensionality of data, capturing the most important features. In recommender systems, it helps in identifying latent factors that influence user preferences.

## Python Concepts
### Libraries Used
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and matrix operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms and metrics.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.

### Coding Techniques
